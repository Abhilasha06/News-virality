Order NowSEOUL: South Korea's government has dismissed rumours that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in fragile condition, as speculation about his health intensifies amid the North's silence on his whereabouts.There are concerns, particularly in Seoul and Washington, about what would happen to North Korea and its nuclear programme if anything had actually happened to Kim.For South Korea and the US, Kim's absence would mean the departure of a man they've dealt with over the past two years to try to achieve the North's denuclearisation, though talks have stalled in recent months.Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul told a closed-door forum in Seoul that South Korea has “enough intelligence to confidently say that there are no unusual developments” in rival North Korea that would back up speculation about Kim's health, his ministry said on Monday.The minister would not reveal at Sunday's forum what specific intelligence led to that conclusion, but he stressed that it was reached after a thorough analysis.The rumours about Kim's health began to swirl after he missed the April 15 commemoration of the 108th birthday of his grandfather, North Korea founder Kim Il Sung Kim Jong Un is the third generation of his family to rule North Korea, and he hadn't missed the event, one of the most important in the North, since assuming power after his father, Kim Jong Il , died in late 2011.North Korea's state media has since made no mention of Kim's health or his public activities, though they said he had received some messages of greeting from foreign countries.On Monday, North Korea's state TV broadcast said Kim sent his thanks to workers and officials at a tourist resort construction site on the east coast.The unification minister's comments are a reiteration of earlier South Korean statements that Kim Jong Un appeared to be handling state affairs normally and that no unusual activities had been detected in North Korea.
Those comments, however, failed to dispel the rumours about Kim.As the absolute leader of a country with a nuclear weapons programme, Kim's health is matter of intense interest both regionally and globally.
If something were to happen to Kim, some experts say it could lead to instability in North Korea.South Korea's presidential office earlier said it has information that Kim has been staying out of Pyongyang , North Korea's capital, and that there had been no emergency readiness order issued by the North's military or the ruling Workers' Party that likely would have been made if Kim were truly in serious condition.On Monday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in repeated an offer to conduct some inter-Korean cooperation projects such as a joint anti-coronavirus quarantine campaign.Moon also said he will strive for mutual prosperity “based on confidence between Chairman Kim and me and our firm resolve to (achieve) peace.”Monday was the second anniversary of Moon's first summit with Kim at the Korean border village of Panmunjom Moon, a liberal who favours a negotiated settlement of the North Korean nuclear issue, facilitated US-North Korea nuclear diplomacy, including the first summit between President Donald Trump and Kim in Singapore in June 2018.A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorised to talk to the media, said earlier this week that the latest rumours about Kim's health had not changed the US assessment of the information as “speculation.”Satellite photos released Saturday by 38 North, a website specialising in North Korea studies, showed that a train likely belonging to Kim has been parked at his compound on the country's east coast since last week.“The train's presence does not prove the whereabouts of the North Korean leader or indicate anything about his health, but it does lend weight to reports that Kim is staying at an elite area on the country's eastern coast,” 38 North said.","FILE - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

An unplanned grand experiment is changing Earth. As people across the globe stay home to stop the spread of the coronavirus, the air has cleaned up fast, at least temporarily. Smog stopped choking New Delhi, one of the most polluted cities on Earth, and India's getting views of sights not seen in decades. Nitrogen dioxide pollution in the U.S. Northeast is down 30 percent. Rome's air pollution levels are down more than half from a year ago. People are seeing animals in places and at times they aren't used to. Goats took over a town in Wales. A coyote frolicked near San Francisco's Golden Gate bridge. A wild puma, likely from nearby hills, was spotted roaming the mostly deserted streets of Santiago, Chile.

ISLAMABAD: The Balakot airstrike and the abrogation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution to bifurcate Jammu and Kashmir are the two significant events that will have a ""lasting imprint"" on the geopolitical situation of South Asia, according to Pakistan army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa In an article in the 'Green Book 2020', a research journal of the Pakistan army which is recognised by the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan and published biennially, Gen Bajwa also describes Kashmir as a “nuclear flashpoint”.General Bajwa being the Patron-in-Chief of the journal expressed his view in a “Note” at the first page of the publication.""Year 2019 witnessed two significant events which will have lasting imprint on the geopolitics of this region; first, the unwarranted Balakot Strike by Indian Air Force on 26th February and second, the unilateral annexation"" of Jammu and Kashmir on August 5, through abrogation of Article 370 and 35A, the Pakistan Army chief said.""Former was a coercive attempt to carve out space for war under nuclear overhang and enforce compellence; adroitly denied by Pakistan air force the very next day, through a calibrated and proportionate response – Indian craving for establishing a New Normal was stymied comprehensively.""The latter, despite condemnation by the World at large, continues to haunt the lives of over eight million Muslims"" of Kashmir..."" he wrote.General Bajwa goes on to say: “Kashmir is a nuclear flashpoint and in total disregard to international norms, Mr (Narendra) Modi has not only endangered the immediate neighbourhood, but has also raised the ante for the entire World.”The powerful army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 70 plus years of existence, has hitherto wielded considerable power in the matters of security and foreign policy.Pakistan and India were almost on the brink of a war following the Pulwama terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir in February 2019 that killed dozens of CRPF soldiers and prompted India to carry out air strikes on terror camps in Balakot city in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.The strained ties between India and Pakistan further nose-dived following the abrogation of Article 370 in August to withdraw the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. The move angered Pakistan, which downgraded diplomatic ties with India and expelled the Indian High Commissioner stationed in Islamabad.India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 was its internal matter. It also advised Pakistan to accept the reality and stop all anti-India propaganda.In the 'Green Book 2020' editorial, Editor-in-Chief Lt Gen Sher Afgan made a case for the changing global order due to the impact of the latest technologies and revolutions in the military and strategic thoughts.""New players like China & Russia are pushing the US led International Liberal Order towards an era of more multipolar power centres. Regionalism is gaining currency, Populism sentiment is high and traditional power centres are grappling to remain atop,” he wrote.He said that South Asia, due to its strategic location and role in world politics, is also under a great impact of this rapid transformation in the geo-politics and geo-economics and Pakistan armed forces had superbly tackled through cross-domain responses.Former diplomat Shamshad Ahmad Khan in his article, 'India-Pakistan Relations: In Perspective', wrote that Pakistan has been living with a lingering suspicion that India had never reconciled to the sub-continent's partition and facing India's hostility and belligerence.He said that as one of the oldest unresolved international conflicts, Kashmir is today ""a nuclear flashpoint.""There are other articles in the 'Green Book 2020' about the regional and global situation.

Order NowLANDON: Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday warned against relaxing the coronavirus restrictions too soon as the country was still facing a moment of ""maximum risk"", in his first remarks since returning to work after contracting the disease that has killed over 20,000 in the UK.While declaring that the tide is being turned on the coronavirus pandemic in the country, he urged the British public to contain their impatience against the crippling lockdown.“We are beginning to turn the tide…There are real signs we are passing through the peak,” said Johnson, in an upbeat address to the nation on the steps of 10 Downing Street.Johnson, 55, had been recuperating from his intensive care treatment at a London hospital earlier this month after he contracted the deadly virus.

LANDON: Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday warned against relaxing the coronavirus restrictions too soon as the country was still facing a moment of ""maximum risk"", in his first remarks since returning to work after contracting the disease that has killed over 20,000 in the UK.While declaring that the tide is being turned on the coronavirus pandemic in the country, he urged the British public to contain their impatience against the crippling lockdown.“We are beginning to turn the tide…There are real signs we are passing through the peak,” said Johnson, in an upbeat address to the nation on the steps of 10 Downing Street.Johnson, 55, had been recuperating from his intensive care treatment at a London hospital earlier this month after he contracted the deadly virus. He returned to 10 Downing Street on Sunday evening from his prime ministerial countryside retreat at Chequers, where he had been based since his discharge from St Thomas' Hospital on April 12.""I ask you to contain your impatience because I believe now we are coming to the end of the first phase of this conflict,” he said, promising “maximum transparency” on the decisions to be taken as the UK enters phase two of the Covid-19 fightback, which will involve one by one firing up the ""economic engines"" of the UK economy.Johnson said the UK has ""so far collectively shielded our National Health Service "" and ""flattened the peak"" - but he could not yet say when or which restrictions would be lifted to ease lockdown.Johnson wanted to send out a clear message that this is the moment of “maximum risk”, making it imperative that no steps can be taken to ease up restrictions that could lead to a risk of a “second spike” of infections.And comparing the fight to someone being attacked, he noted: ""If this virus were a physical assailant, an unexpected and invisible mugger – which I can tell you from personal experience, it is – then this is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle it to the floor.""And so it follows that this is the moment of opportunity, this is the moment when we can press home our advantage, it is also the moment of maximum risk.""I know there will be many people looking at our apparent success, and beginning to wonder whether now is the time to go easy on those social distancing measures…I entirely share your urgency, it's the government's urgency and yet we must also recognise the risk of a second spike,""He said the UK has ""so far collectively shielded our NHS"" and ""flattened the peak"" – but he could not yet say when or which restrictions would be lifted to ease lockdown.The UK PM chaired a regular special Cabinet meeting on Monday as he takes back charge of the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed 20,732 lives in the UK.""It is hard to find the words to express my debt to the NHS [National Health Service] for saving my life,” he said, in his message to the medical team on leaving the hospital.UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who has been deputising for the UK prime minister as the First Secretary of State during the leave of absence, described his boss' return as a “boost for the government and a boost for the country”.“He's raring to go,” Raab said.Johnson resumed work amid growing pressure from within his own Conservative Party backbenchers as well the Opposition parties to set out a clear exit strategy to begin lifting the strict lockdown measures in place to curb the spread of coronavirus.""If there is a question over whether something is necessary or not, I think we should err on the side of openness and trying to make sure that more people can get on with their lives and more people can get on with getting back to their jobs,"" said Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the Tory party's influential backbench 1922 Committee.Opposition Labour Party's shadow cabinet minister Rachel Reeves said the UK should ""potentially"" be following the example of other European countries like Belgium, Germany and Denmark , which have already signalled partial re-opening of some businesses and schools.""We want to work with the government in bringing forward a plan and getting it right,"" she said.Officials are reported to be working on a Singapore-style plan for passengers arriving at UK sea and airports to be quarantined for 14 days as part of the second phase of the measures, which must be reviewed by law on May 7.However, UK Environment Minister George Eustice seemed to dismiss the idea at the daily Downing Street briefing on Sunday.“As we move to a new phase at some point in the future – we are not there yet – international travel could become a more significant part of the risk to manage,"" he said.Johnson has meanwhile kept in contact with his ministers and officials and held his weekly audience by telephone with Queen Elizabeth II last week, indicating his readiness for full-time duties.He held a long meeting with Raab and UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Friday ahead of his formal return, during which the senior team is believed to have thrashed out aspects of the next phase in the government's Covid-19 strategy.The strict social distancing norms in place in the UK were imposed in a televised address by Johnson on March 23 and they require people to stay at home, shutting most businesses and preventing gatherings of more than two people.","Boris Johnson back at work, warns against relaxing coronavirus restrictions"

BEIJING: China will focus testing for Covid-19 on high-risk groups such as people from infected areas or with symptoms, the head of a top state research institute said on Monday, suggesting that authorities are not about to rush into large-scale testing.The government said recently that it intends to carry out more widespread testing to quickly identify and isolate carriers, following spikes in cases linked to people arriving from abroad and new local transmissions.But China also said accuracy of tests must be improved and more laboratories should be set up. It is also unclear who would pay for any mass testing of hundreds of millions of people - the state, employers or the individual.""(The country's) current testing strategy matches our epidemic control and prevention strategy,"" Jin Qi, president of the Institute of Pathogen Biology at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Tests are being carried mostly on high-risk groups such as people with symptoms or from infected areas, schools and hospitals, Jin told reporters at a briefing in Beijing Other groups that request testing, such as those returning to work that involves a high density of people, will receive tests as far as is possible, he added.While people running a high fever and suffering from breathing problems are easy to identify, some carriers of the novel coronavirus show few or none of the usual symptoms and are just as capable of infecting others.As of Sunday, 974 asymptomatic cases were under medical observation, Chinese health authorities said, after testing positive for the virus.There is no official estimate of the number of asymptomatic carriers who are yet to be tested. Wuhan in central Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak in China, has doubled the number of tests to 60,000-65,000 a day since a lockdown on the city ended on April 8, to ensure that only residents who test negative leave the city.To keep track of people's test status, the government recently launched an online mobile service allowing people to retain a history of their test results.But not all are convinced that mass testing is needed.""I don't think it is necessary to get tested if people stay in the city and show no symptoms,"" said Meng, 32, who works for an overseas education services company in Beijing.""Besides, there are people who show symptoms two days after the coronavirus test. If I do the test today, can I guarantee that I will not be exposed to the virus tomorrow?""There are also financial considerations for the individual paying for tests. In China, the nuclei acid test, which involves swabbing the back of a patient's throat or respiratory tract to detect the virus' genome, costs at least 200 yuan ($28.26) on average.The cost for people who need multiple tests over a period of time could be significant, especially those earning low wages such as migrant workers. Some patients also test positive only after multiple rounds of testing.""The bill could be spilt,"" said Meng, declining to give her full name.""Both the individual and the government should bear half of it, which will reduce the pressure on both sides.""

MOSCOW: Russia overtook China in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases on Monday when its tally climbed above 87,000, as pressure rose on the government to consider easing lockdown restrictions for businesses to help shore up the rattled economy.Russia, the world's largest country by territory, has been on lockdown since President Vladimir Putin announced the closure of most public spaces on March 25. These measures are due to expire on April 30 and Putin has not yet said if he plans to extend them.Anna Popova, the head of Russia's safety watchdog Rospotrebnadzor, told state television on Monday that, in her view, restrictions should be in place until May 12.Earlier Prime Minister Mikhail Mishushin asked his government to submit proposals by Thursday to ease some of the restrictions on businesses. Many firms have warned that they risk going bankrupt if the lockdown continues, and thousands of jobs have been laid off.""As soon as situation will be changing for good, we would need to consider a step-by-step cancellation of restrictions on certain companies... operations,"" Mishustin told an online government meeting.On Monday, the authorities reported 6,198 new cases of the new coronavirus, bringing the total to 87,147, with 794 deaths.ENERGY SECTOR IN FOCUSRussia, one of the world's top oil and gas exporters, is particularly vulnerable to the spread of the coronavirus at production sites. Most are located in remote areas accessible by only air, meaning the workers in close proximity, increasing their risk of infection.Citing local officials, Interfax said on Monday that an airport in Sabetta in the northern Yamal peninsula had been shut down for quarantine after cases of the new coronavirus were detected at the Yamal LNG production site controlled by Novatek .A total of 143 cases were confirmed in Sabetta, the local crisis response center said separately.In the northwestern region of Murmansk where Novatek is building a plant to supply its next LNG project, the Arctic LNG 2, over 800 workers tested positive for coronavirus, the local crisis response centre said on Sunday.Velesstroy, a sub-contractor for the plant, temporarily suspended work at the site near Murmansk but said in a statement to Reuters that the project will remain on schedule.To limit the risk of contagion at over 1,000 power plants in Russia, including nuclear ones, over 200,000 employees - or nearly a third - were recently tested for the virus, the energy ministry said.It did not say how many of those tests returned positive.Mainland China, where the new coronavirus first emerged, reported a total of 82,830 cases on Monday. China is now fighting an increased number of new cases coming from Russia.","Russia overtakes China with coronavirus cases at 87,000"

WASHINGTON: An Indian-American NGO has raised $1 million to fight hunger in India and the United States amid the the coronavirus pandemic.This translates to 4,700,000 meals for people in the United States and ration kits for 106,000 migrant workers in India that will last them seven to 10 days, said M R Rangaswami, founder and chairman of the board of NGO Indiaspora It was a volunteer group in San Jose, California that made the last donation of $5,000 after which the campaign fund crossed $1 million.“It is so heartening to see that this is just a group of regular Indian Americans, who are a volunteer group, and are gifting to different non-profits and charities. They on their own decided that this was the best cause,” Rangaswami, an investor, entrepreneur and philanthropist, told PTI.The money raised by Indiaspora through its 'ChaloGive for COVID-19 ' online campaign will be used to provide relief directly to vulnerable population in both the countries.Contributions given are sent to two beneficiary organisations, Feeding America in the US and Goonj in India.Feeding America is using the contributions to bolster its nationwide network of 200 food banks. Goonj is using the funds to provide food, dry ration and hygiene kits to displaced migrants in parts of eighteen states in India.In this hour of coronavirus pandemic that has hit both the United States and India, the Indian-American community has resoundingly shown up across the country, said Rangaswami.“It's not just donations to Indiaspora.

It has been an outpouring from across the country, which I have never seen before,” said the California-based venture capitalist, who has closely following communities' philanthropic activities for long time.Such an outpouring of support was last time seen during the Gujarat earthquake in 2001, but that time the call was given by the then US President Bill Clinton and Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, he said.“Since then, I have not seen anything of this scale (of giving by Indian-Americans),” he said, adding that the community this time is contributing both their time and money.SEWA International, another non-profit body has raised more than $500,000 for its coronavirus relief work.One of the donations that helped Indiaspora cross the $1 million threshold came from Bay-area based volunteer group Aram Sei, whose vision is to support grassroots charities worldwide in the areas of education and healthcare.“Our team of twelve members is proud to support the ChaloGive fundraiser initiative that helps us make a direct impact to those in need,” said Sangeetha Lakshminarayanan, president and founder of Aram Sei.“We feel fortunate to be able to make a difference in our country of origin and the country we have embraced and made our home,” she said.“There was a huge desire in our community to help during this crisis, and we provided an easy way to give. The Indian diaspora stood up and rose to the occasion when the ultimate time of reckoning arrived,” said Indiaspora's executive director, Sanjeev Joshipura.“We want to do everything we can to help our country of birth and our country of citizenship. It is not either or, it is US and India,” he added.On Thursday, Indiaspora also added new partnerships for the ChaloGive campaign.In addition to former Pepsico CEO Indra Nooyi, noted philanthropists Rohini and Nandan Nilekani, former US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy and actor Nandita Das, all existing 'ChaloGive for COVID-19' Ambassadors, Indiaspora announced the addition of GiveIndia CEO Atul Satija, and Raj and Aradhana (Anna) Asava, the pioneers of the 'HungerMitao' (wipe out hunger) movement in America.""Having enabled over 10 million meals to-date, HungerMitao is proud to partner with Indiaspora to raise funds for the food challenged in this time of crisis,” said Raj and Anna Asava, who both have a successful track record of partnering with food banks across North America.“HungerMitao is a grassroots initiative engaging the Indian-American community in the fight against hunger through the Feeding America network of food banks,"" he said.""Just as India's social indices had begun to improve, coronavirus threatens to bring 80 per cent of India's working population - the informal sector - to its knees,” said Atul Satija, founder of India's largest donation platform, and Indiaspora's India partner for ChaloGive.""We appeal to the huge Indian diaspora to support the immediate needs of hunger and reviving livelihoods before they fall back into extreme poverty, and rebuilding the lives of the less fortunate in the longer term,"" he said.The campaign at ChaloGive.org continues, with a live Facebook rally planned on May 4 at 9 pm EST/6 pm PST on the eve of Giving Tuesday for Covid-19, a media release said.ChaloGive for Covid-19 is the second online campaign by Indiaspora. Its inaugural campaign was launched on October 2, 2019 on the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and concluded on October 8.It highlighted more than 20 organisations with successful track records in areas of poverty alleviation and empowerment, health, and education.","Coronavirus: Indian-American NGO raises $1 million for relief work in US, India"
